.. warning::
   The software is under development. Use it at your own risk, and please send your feedback to Buyun Liang via liang664@umn.edu.

NCVX (NonConVeX) is a user-friendly and scalable python package for NCVX optimization, which is revamped and translated from the `GRANSO <http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/>`_ package.  
In order to lower the barriers to general users and solve modern machine/deep learning problems, we introduce several main features 
including auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, scalable QP solver and open-source dependencies.
