Highlights
========================

Tutorial Sessions
---------------------

We delivered tutorials around constrained deep learning and NCVX in SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 23) to the machine learning and data science communities, as well as other domains including computer vision, machine learning, optimization, and health informatics. 

See our tutorial proposals and tutorial slides for more details: `SDM23 proposal <_files/2023_SDM_PyGRANSO_Tutorial.pdf>`_ and `SDM23 tutorial slides <_files/SDM23_Deep_Learning_with_Nontrivial_Constraints.pdf>`_.
