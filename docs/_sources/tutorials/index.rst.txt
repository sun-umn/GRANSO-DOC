Tutorial Sessions
========================

We will deliver tutorials around constrained deep learning and NCVX in SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 23) and 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2023) to the data science and signal processing communities, as well as other domains including computer vision, machine learning, optimization, and health informatics. 

See our tutorial proposals for more details: `SDM23 proposal <_files/2023_SDM_PyGRANSO_Tutorial.pdf>`_ and `ICASSP2023 proposal <_files/2023_ICASSP_PyGRANSO_Tutorial.pdf>`_.
