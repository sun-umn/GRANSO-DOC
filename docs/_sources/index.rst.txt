NCVX (NonConVeX) is a user-friendly and scalable python package for solving general 
nonconvex, especially nonsmooth and constrained problems. NCVX, `GRANSO <http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/>`_ translated and revamped, features auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, scalable QP solver, and zero dependency on proprietary packages. As a highlight, NCVX can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind. NCVX is being developed by `GLOVEX <https://sunju.org>`_ at the Department of Computer Science \& Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
