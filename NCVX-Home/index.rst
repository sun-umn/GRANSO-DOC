**Introduction**
==========================

NCVX (NonConVeX) is a user-friendly and scalable python package for solving general nonconvex, especially nonsmooth and constrained problems. NCVX is being developed by `GLOVEX <https://glovex.umn.edu/>`_ at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

PyGRANSO is the first open-source software in our NCVX family. PyGRANSO, GRANSO translated and revamped, features auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, scalable QP solver, and zero dependency on proprietary packages. As a highlight, PyGRANSO can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.
