**Introduction**
==========================

NCVX (NonConVeX) is a user-friendly and scalable python package for solving general nonconvex, especially nonsmooth and constrained problems. NCVX is being developed by `GLOVEX <https://glovex.umn.edu/>`_ at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 

The initial release of NCVX contains the solver PyGRANSO, a PyTorch-enabled port of `GRANSO <http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/>`_ incorporating auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, and support for new QP solvers. As a highlight, PyGRANSO can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.
